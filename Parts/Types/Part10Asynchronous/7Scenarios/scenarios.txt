Asynchronous programming scenarios

I/O Bound tasks - Download data from Web
s_downloadButton.Clicked += async (o, e) =>
{
    // This line will yield control to the UI as the request
    // from the web service is happening.
    //
    // The UI thread is now free to perform other work.
    var stringData = await s_httpClient.GetStringAsync(URL);
    DoSomethingWithData(stringData);
};



CPU bound -  Perform a calculation for a game
static DamageResult CalculateDamageDone()
{
    return new DamageResult()
    {
        // Code omitted:
        //
        // Does an expensive calculation and returns
        // the result of that calculation.
    };
}

s_calculateButton.Clicked += async (o, e) =>
{
    // This line will yield control to the UI while CalculateDamageDone()
    // performs its work. The UI thread is free to perform other work.
    var damageResult = await Task.Run(() => CalculateDamageDone());
    DisplayDamage(damageResult);
};
